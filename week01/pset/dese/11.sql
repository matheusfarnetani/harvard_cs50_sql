-- Is there a relationship between school expenditures and
-- graduation rates? In 11.sql, write a SQL query to display
-- the names of schools, their per-pupil expenditure, and their
-- graduation rate. Sort the schools from greatest per-pupil
-- expenditure to least. If two schools have the same per-pupil
-- expenditure, sort by school name.
--     You should assume a school spends the same amount per-pupil
--     their district as a whole spends.
